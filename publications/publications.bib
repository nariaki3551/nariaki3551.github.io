	abstract = {Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and adversarial attacks used to generate such examples have attracted considerable research interest. Although existing methods based on the steepest descent have achieved high attack success rates, ill-conditioned problems occasionally reduce their performance. To address this limitation, we utilize the conjugate gradient (CG) method, which is effective for this type of problem, and propose a novel attack algorithm inspired by the CG method, named the Auto Conjugate Gradient (ACG) attack. The results of large-scale evaluation experiments conducted on the latest robust models show that, for most models, ACG was able to find more adversarial examples with fewer iterations than the existing SOTA algorithm Auto-PGD (APGD). We investigated the difference in search performance between ACG and APGD in terms of diversification and intensification, and define a measure called Diversity Index (DI) to quantify the degree of diversity. From the analysis of the diversity using this index, we show that the more diverse search of the proposed method remarkably improves its attack success rate.},

	abstract = {Map matching is an essential preprocessing step for most trajectory-based intelligent transport system services. Due to device capability constraints and the lack of a high-performance model, map matching for low-sampling-rate trajectories is of particular interest. Therefore, we developed a time-expanded graph matching (TEG-matching) that has three advantages (1) high speed and accuracy, as it is robust for spatial measurement error and a pause such as at traffic lights; (2) being parameter-free, that is, our algorithm has no predetermined hyperparameters; and (3) only requiring ordered locations for map matching. Given a set of low-frequency GPS data, we construct a time-expanded graph (TEG) whose path from source to sink represents a candidate route. We find the shortest path on TEG to obtain the matching route with a small area between the vehicle trajectory. Additionally, we introduce two general speedup techniques (most map matching methods can apply) bottom-up segmentation and fractional cascading. Numerical experiments with worldwide vehicle trajectories in a public dataset show that TEG-matching outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and speed, and we verify the effectiveness of the two general speedup techniques.},

	abstract = {The studies of browsing behavior have gained increasing attention in web analysis for providing better service. Most of the conventional approaches focus on simple indices such as average dwell time and conversion rate. These indices make similar evaluations to websites even if their features are significantly different. Moreover, such statistical indices are not sensitive to the dynamics of users'interests. In this paper, we propose a new framework for measuring a website's attractiveness that takes into account both the distribution and dynamics of users'interests. Within the framework, we define a new index for the website, called Attractiveness Factor, which evaluates the degree of users'attention. It consists of three procedures: First, we capture the transition of users'interests during browsing by solving a nonnegative matrix factorization and constrained network flow problems. To accommodate multiple types of interests of a user, we applied a soft clustering as opposed to a hard clustering to model attributes of users and websites. Second, for each website, the feature of each cluster is obtained by fitting the dwell time distribution with Weibull distribution. Finally, we calculate Attractiveness Factor of a website by applying the results of clustering and fitting. Attractiveness Factor depends on the distribution of the dwell time of users interested in the website, which reflects the change of interest of users. Numerical experiments with real web access data of Yahoo Japan News are conducted by solving extremely large-scale optimization problems. They show that Attractiveness Factor captures more exceptional information about browsing behavior more effectively than well-used indices. Attractive factors give low ratings to category pages; however, it can assign high ratings to websites that attract many people, such as hot topic news about the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Japan's new imperial era'REIWA,'and North Korea---the United States Hanoi Summit. Moreover, we demonstrate that Attractiveness Factor can detect the tendency of users'attention to each website at a given time interval of the day.},

	abstract = {Lattice-based cryptography has received attention as a next-generation encryption technique, because it is believed to be secure against attacks by classical and quantum computers. Its essential security depends on the hardness of solving the shortest vector problem (SVP). In the cryptography, to determine security levels, it is becoming significantly more important to estimate the hardness of the SVP by high-performance computing. In this study, we develop the world's first distributed and asynchronous parallel SVP solver, the MAssively Parallel solver for SVP (MAP-SVP). It can parallelize algorithms for solving the SVP by applying the Ubiquity Generator framework, which is a generic framework for branch-and-bound algorithms. The MAP-SVP is suitable for massive-scale parallelization, owing to its small memory footprint, low communication overhead, and rapid checkpoint and restart mechanisms. We demonstrate its performance and scalability of the MAP-SVP by using up to 100,032 cores to solve instances of the Darmstadt SVP Challenge.},

	abstract = {Lattice problems are a class of optimization problems that are notably hard. There are no classical or quantum algorithms known to solve these problems efficiently. Their hardness has made lattices a major cryptographic primitive for post-quantum cryptography. Several different approaches have been used for lattice problems with different computational profiles; some suffer from super-exponential time, and others require exponential space. This motivated us to develop a novel lattice problem solver, CMAP-LAP, based on the clever coordination of different algorithms that run massively in parallel. With our flexible framework, heterogeneous modules run asynchronously in parallel on a large-scale distributed system while exchanging information, which drastically boosts the overall performance. We also implement full checkpoint-and-restart functionality, which is vital to high-dimensional lattice problems. CMAP-LAP facilitates the implementation of large-scale parallel strategies for lattice problems since all the functions are designed to be customizable and abstract. Through numerical experiments with up to 103,680 cores, we evaluated the performance and stability of our system and demonstrated its high capability for future massive-scale experiments.},

	abstract = {The learning with errors (LWE) problem assures the security of modern lattice-based cryptosystems. It can be reduced to classical lattice problems such as the shortest vector problem (SVP) and the closest vector problem (CVP). In particular, the search-LWE problem is reduced to a particular case of SVP by Kannan{\textquoteright}s embedding technique. Lattice basis reduction is a mandatory tool to solve lattice problems. In this paper, we give a new strategy to solve the search-LWE problem by lattice reduction over projected bases. Compared with a conventional method of reducing a whole lattice basis, our strategy reduces only a part of the basis and, hence, it gives a practical speed-up in solving the problem. We also develop a reduction algorithm for a projected basis, and apply it to solving several instances in the LWE challenge, which has been initiated since the middle of 2016 in order to assess the hardness of the LWE problem.},

	abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are attracting significant attention from a number of industries, including social infrastructure, manufacturing, retail, among others. We can easily gather big datasets of people and transportation movements by utilizing camera and sensor technologies, and create new industrial applications by optimizing and simulating social mobility in the cyberspace. In this paper, we develop the system which automatically performs a series of processes, including object detection, multiple object tracking, and mobility optimization. The mobility of humans and objects is one of the essential components in the real world. Therefore, our system can be widely applied to various application fields. Our major contributions to this paper are remarkable performance improvement of multiple object tracking and building the new mobility optimization engine. In the former, we improve the multiple object tracker using K-Shortest Paths (KSP), which achieves significant data reduction and acceleration by specifying and deleting unnecessary nodes. Numerical experiments show that our proposed tracker is over three times faster than the original KSP tracker while keeping the accuracy. We formulate the mobility optimization problem as the SATisfiability problem (SAT) and the Integer Programming problem (IP) in the latter. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the total transit time can be reduced from 30 s to 10 s. We discuss the characteristics of solutions obtained by the two formulations. We can finally select the appropriate optimization method according to the constraints of calculation time and accuracy for real applications.},

The vehicle powertrain simulator makes it easier to evaluate the powertrain system. In this paper, we utilize a Toyota Hybrid System (THS) simulator to obtain a long-term control that optimizes the fuel efficiency when the vehicle speed over a certain period is given. Our proposed method obtains optimal long-term control by solving the shortest path problem with state of charge (SOC) constraints after constructing a graph expressing the transition of the fuel and battery consumption. We also propose a search method for vehicle control using bicubic spline interpolation without the preparation of a controller. We finally remove almost all edges from a graph by 97.2% at most through the utilization of 0-1 integer linear programming, which enables a 3.88x speedup in obtaining the optimal vehicle control.},
